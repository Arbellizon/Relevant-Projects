Tai Chi

I am doing the makeup assignment on the WuHao form.

What I noticed right away from watching the video, was the fluidity of the person practicing. Each step was placed with a purpose and each turn, step, and pivot moved effortlessly from one form to the next. More than anything it became clear that tai chi for an experienced player is like a dance. With each movement leading to the next, but there was no rush to get to the next move.
Also evident was some of the principle of Tai Chi. Such as clear and clean weight transference, keeping the knees bent, and moving through a slight resistance.
First, the player clearly demonstrated proper weight transference throughout the forms. Many times going from one stance to the other. 
The player made smooth transitions by either turning or pivoting on one foot only. 
All while maintaining the fluid movements from form to form. Another thing that showed a proper transference of weight was the easy balance demonstrated by the player.
Next, the player maintains bent knees throughout each movement only ever straitening a leg as the form required and to start and finish the forms. 
The Last principle of Tai Chi that was demonstrated movement that acts as if moving through a slight resistance.  
This could be seen throughout the demonstration as the player movements mimicked a graceful dance. 
This dance spoke of no waited movement and although the resistance was present it served not slow down the actual movement, but to speed it up.
